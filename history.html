			<h2>History</h2>
			
			<p>Clockwork Trucking Inc. was created by Aaron Eckles, a solutions-driven former 
			Combat Medic in the U.S. Army. When he hung up his uniform in 2008, he found that there were 
			less opportunities in the medical field, and decided to start a career in logistics. Aaron
			started training at Frozen Foods Express, Inc, and grew from a trainee, to a trainer, to 
			an owner operator within 2 years. With his drive for success, Aaron managed to start a 
			contracted company through FFE, Inc.</p>
			
			<p>Clockwork Trucking, Inc. now owns 10 trucks, and is focussing on training new drivers 
			for FFE, Inc, to be safe, competent additions to the organization. Clockwork itself employs
			only the best of our trainees, chosen by our experienced drivers. Only one in every ten 
			drivers trained by Clockwork drivers will be asked to join the Clockwork team.</p>
			
			<p>Military excellence is a big part of Clockwork's success. Many of the employees are
			former military, which contributes great work ethics, personal values, and discipline. 
			Although Employees are gained through training of our contracted company, FFE, Inc. we 
			find that the military service members are a good fit for our organization.</p>
			
			<p>Safe, efficient, fast service is the company goal.</p>
